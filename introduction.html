	<h1>Joseph School of Financial Discipline</h1><br>
	<h2>Introduction<br>Class 1</h2>
	<h3>God gave earth with all its riches to man to subdue and rule!</h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">	
	“God blessed these humans by saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it! Be masters over the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly, and every living thing that crawls on the earth!" Gen 1:28  <br><br>

	Earth divided into continents <br>
	“When the Most High gave nations as their inheritance, when he separated the human race, he set boundaries for the people according to the number of the children of God.” Deu 32:8  <br>
	Men  progressed in acquiring skills ,   invented  tools and equipped themselves for  survival and sustenance on this earth. <br>
	They  explored the land <br>
	Made new inventions &  became rich<br>
	Divided  the land and wealth of the earth among themselves &  their descendants. <br>
	Organized  themselves as villages, towns, districts, States, countries, continents etc., <br>
	Appointed leaders over  them to protect their borders,  and  to see to the welfare of the people. <br>

	Men explored the richness of the earth! <br>
	As years went by, as civilization  progresses, human beings realized  out how rich the  earth, (the land, the nature, the sky and the ocean is which God has created! <br>
	They started cultivating the land and  began rearing animals. The barter system which they practised gave way to monetary system.  Those who  prospered and possessed more lands or animals,  were called rich.  <br><br>
	Gen 13:2  Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. <br>
	2 Ch 18:1  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance <br><br></p>

<h3>	Various meanings of wealth?</h3> 
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
 The word “wealth” has different connotations. For different people it means different things. For certain people, it means <br>
Money <br>
Knowledge <br>
Health their  hard Labour <br>
Their Children and descendants. <br>
Assets they have (land, property, buildings, institutions  they have) 
Character, principles people  hold 
Relationship with God.<br>
 For that they are willing to sacrifice <br><br>

<h3> The greatest Wealth of God – Jesus</h3> 
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
	The greatest wealth of Father  =  His Son<br>
	In Jesus Father handed over all His wealth to the world<br>
	Jesus inside of Him and walking with Him is the greatest wealth a human being can possess in this world.<br>
	 This is the wealth Adam  was given free. Even though he lost it, God restored this wealth through His Son Jesus Christ.  <br><br>

	Need of the school of Financial discipline? <br>
	Anybody who chooses Jesus Christ is the wealthiest man is this world. <br>
	 “And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in the Messiah Jesus”. Ph 4:19 <br>
	But today, many even the so called Christians, prefer the gifts (finance, assets, promotion etc) which Jesus Christ give, than Jesus Himself. <br>
	Thus they err and fall into many temptations. Hence the need of this school, Financial Discipline. <br><br></p>

For every organization, institution, company, firm, it has its own disciplinary rules and regulations. When they are violated, the subject is punished and even dismissed from the company depending upon the gravity of the rule. <br>
Is there any discipline for acquiring wealth and  finance for human beings while living on earth? <br>
	Yes. There are. <br>

	Exo 3:22  But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.”<br><br></p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
	TN Chief Minister (late) convicted & arrested for amassing wealth. <br>
	Many Govt officials convicted & arrested for amassing wealth.<br> <br>
	Bible is the   Constitution  the Lord God has given for every human being living on earth. It explicitly  spells the code of conduct &  behaviour of  an individual  in all areas, also  in the pursuit of wealth. <br>
	Bible - solution to all the problems in this world.<br>
	Make   a spread sheet of all the disciplinary laws regarding Finance =  You will get the solution for all the problems existing in this world. <br><br>

<h3>God’s punishment drought & scarcity of water </h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
"I also have scheduled food shortages for you in all of your cities, and lack of bread in all of your settlements, but you haven't  returned to me," declares the LORD. but you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. <br><br>
 
"I  overthrew your cities, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You've  become like a burning ember, snatched from the fire, but you have not  returned to me," declares the LORD.   prepare to be summoned to your God, Israel!" Am 4:6-12  <br><br>

<h3>Problems of the World – result of violating God’s financial rules 
When  we violate the rules of Yahweh, it brings heavy loss of wealth and lives. </h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">All the problems of the world today, 
  hunger, famine, poverty, sickness, war, tsunami, floods, wild animals, fire, earth quakes, 
can be traced back to violation of a particular  law or  laws put forward by God in Bible.<br>
 Whether it is of any  individual, of a particular nation or of the whole the world, no doubt it is due to the violation of a law in the Bible. <br>
Violation of the financial discipline of  Bible  brings disasters of nature. <br>
Yahweh, Father of Jesus Christ and ours - put forward explicit conditions for human beings in Bible  for earning wealth, storing it up, methods of spending it, and the correlation in making money and spending it.  <br><br>

	Financial discipline covers all areas 
Covers all areas like
One’s personal life, family, institutions
Govts, companies, natural resources etc.<br>

Children of God need to  consult God in everything, selecting a career, planning your finance etc. <br><br></p>

God gives wealth</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">a man to whom God gives wealth, riches, and honor, so that he lacks none of his heart's desires—but God does not give him the capability to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger consumes them. This is pointless and a grievous affliction. Ecc 6:2<br><br>

Sinners  -Gathering & Collecting money- <br>
Ecc 2:26  For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. <br><br>

Rich man wise in his own eyes:<br>
Pro 28:11  The rich man may be wise in his own opinion; but a discerning, poor man sees through him. <br>
Those who are in a hurry to get riches will be punished<br>
Pro 28:20  The faithful man will prosper with blessings, but whoever is in a hurry to get rich will not escape punishment. <br>

Don’t spend money on what is not bread<br>
Isa 55:2  Why spend your money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in rich food.<br>
Do not  become rich with treachery.<br>

Mic 6:12  Her rich people are filled with violence, and her inhabitants tell lies—their tongues speak deceitfully! 
Shepherds became rich by selling the sheep<br>
Zec  11:5  Their buyers slaughter them without being punished, continuing to sell them as they say, 'Bless the LORD!' and 'I'm rich!' Meanwhile, their shepherds show them no compassion
God sends the rich away empty:<br>
Luk 1:53  He filled hungry people with good things and sent rich people away with nothing. <br><br>

Miseries will overtake the rich <br>

Riches will topple people into temptation <br>
1Tim  6:9  But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin. <br>
Worldly riches make people miserable, pitiable, poor, blind & naked
Rev 3:17  You say, "I am rich. I have become wealthy. I don't need anything." Yet you don't realize that you are miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. <br><br></p>

<h3>	Exercise </h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">	Ecc 2:26  For God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who is good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. <br><br>
	Write the example of a person in your acquaintance or relation, who was given the labour to gather & heap up  money but could not enjoy it. <br>
	Write in detail  how the above verse is applicable to him. <br><br></P>
